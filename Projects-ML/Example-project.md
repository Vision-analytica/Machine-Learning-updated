# Genral Framework of the project
Let's consider a simple example where we have an ML project with two stages - development and Markdown markdown

1. Initialize your ML project: Create a new directory for your project, and initialize it using a tool like git.
    ```bash
    mkdir my-ml-project
    cd my-ml-project
    git init
    ```
2. Set up a virtual environment: To keep your project's dependencies separate from your system's, you can use a virtual environment. Create a new virtual environment and activate it.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Initialize a git repository: Once you've set up your virtual environment, initialize a git repository to track your project's changes.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
4. Write your ML code: Now, you can start writing your ML code. Create a new file called model.py and write your ML model code.
    ```python
    def my_ml_model(x):
        # Your ML model code here
        pass
    ```
5. Commit your changes: Once you've written your ML code, commit your changes to the git repository.
    ```bash
    git add model.py
    git commit -m "Add my ML model"
    ```
6. Prepare your code for production: Now, it's time to prepare your code for production. Write a script called train_model.py that trains your ML model using your development data.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from model import my_ml_model

    # Load your development data
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Train your ML model
    my_ml_model.fit(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'])
    ```
7. Write a script to make predictions: Create a new file called predict.py that allows you to make predictions using your trained ML model.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from model import my_ml_model

    # Load your data
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    # Make predictions
    predictions = my_ml_model.predict(data.drop('target', axis=1))

    # Print predictions
    print(predictions)
    ```
8. Save your trained model: Train your ML model and save it to a file using the train_model.py script.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
9. Make predictions using your trained model: Now, you can use the predict.py script to make predictions using your trained ML model.
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```
10.Prepare your model for deployment: Package your trained model, the predict.py script, and any other necessary files into a directory called model.

    ```bash
    mkdir model
    cp train_model.py model/
    cp predict.py model/
    cp -r data model/
    ```
11. Commit your changes: Finally, commit your changes to the git repository.

    ```bash
    git add model
    git commit -m "Prepare model for deployment"
    ```

12. Write your markdown: Create a new file called README.md and write your markdown documentation. This should include information about your project, how to use it, and any necessary references.
    
    ```markdown
    # My ML Project

    This is a simple ML project that uses a hypothetical ML model.

    ## How to use it

    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Train the model using the `train_model.py` script.
    3. Make predictions using the `predict.py` script.

    ## References

    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
    - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    ```

13. Commit your changes: Finally, commit your changes to the git repository.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add markdown documentation"
```
14. Push your changes to a remote repository: Once you've finished setting up your ML project and markdown documentation, you can push your changes to a remote repository like GitHub or GitLab.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-ml-project.git
git push -u origin master
```
